===================================
Kinetic Information Engine (Protocol 053) - The Jargon Injector

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract "High-Status Vocabulary"
from specific Wikipedia categories. It identifies words that are common *locally* (in the target niche)
but rare *globally* (in general English), signaling deep expertise.

Dependencies:
    pip install scikit-learn numpy

Usage:
    python3 jargon_injector.py "Dermatology"
