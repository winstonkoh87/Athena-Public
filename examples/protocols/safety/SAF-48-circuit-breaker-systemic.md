# Protocol 48: Circuit Breaker (Systemic Pause)

> **Source**: Extracted from Trading Methodology (December 2025)  
> **Related**: Infrastructure & Continuity Hub (3-Second Override), Protocol 35 (Emotional Intensity Dysregulation)  
> **Trigger When**: Cumulative red flags in any domain exceed threshold; compulsivity detected

## 48.1 Core Principle

> **When cumulative damage exceeds threshold, the system forces a pause—regardless of the operator's desire to continue.**

Infrastructure & Continuity Hub (3-Second Override) operates at micro-level: intercepting a single impulse. This protocol operates at macro-level: forcing systematic disengagement when a series of minor violations accumulates into significant damage.

---

## 48.2 The Pattern

```
CUMULATIVE DAMAGE WITHOUT CIRCUIT BREAKER:

Red Flag 1 → "I can recover" → Continue
Red Flag 2 → "Still fine" → Continue
Red Flag 3 → "Just bad luck" → Continue
Red Flag 4 → "One more try" → Continue
Red Flag 5 → "I've invested too much to stop now" → Continue
...
COLLAPSE
```

**The failure mode**: Each individual red flag is survivable, so no single event triggers intervention. But cumulative damage exceeds tolerance before the operator notices.

## 48.3 Circuit Breaker Architecture

### Threshold Definition

| Domain | Red Flag Unit | Trigger Threshold |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Trading** | 1R loss | 5R cumulative |
| **Spending** | Budget breach | 3 in one month |
| **Relationships** | Unreciprocated bid | 3 consecutive |
| **Work** | Missed deadline | 2 in one sprint |
| **Energy** | Sleep debt night | 3 consecutive |

### Forced Protocol

When threshold is reached:

```
1. ⏹️ STOP: Cease all activity in domain immediately
2. ⏸️ PAUSE: Mandatory cooling period (minimum 24 hours)
3. 📝 AAR: After-Action Review (structured debrief)
4. 🔍 DIAGNOSE: Statistical noise or systemic failure?
5. ✅/❌ VERDICT: Resume with adjustments OR exit domain
```

---

## 48.4 The AAR (After-Action Review)

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **What was supposed to happen?** | Establish baseline |
| **What actually happened?** | Document reality |
| **Why the gap?** | Causal analysis |
| **Statistical noise or systemic?** | Classification |
| **What adjustments for next time?** | Improve or exit |

---

## 48.5 Why People Skip the Circuit Breaker

| Trap | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Sunk cost** | "I've already lost X, can't stop now" |
| **Recency bias** | "This bad streak is about to end" |
| **Identity attachment** | "Stopping means I failed" |
| **Compulsivity override** | Autonomic system ignores conscious decision |
| **Normalisation** | Each red flag feels "not that bad" individually |

---

## 48.6 External Enforcement Option

For high-compulsivity domains (C4: 70-90%), consider external enforcement:

- **Trading**: Give someone else password access with veto power
- **Spending**: Joint account with approval requirement
- **Relationships**: Trusted friend with "intervention" authority
- **Work**: Manager or peer accountability partner

> **Design principle**: The circuit breaker CANNOT be overridden by the operator alone. That's the point.

---

## 48.7 Post-Breaker Protocol

After mandatory pause:

| Diagnosis | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Statistical noise** | Resume at reduced intensity |
| **Systemic failure** | Major adjustment before resuming |
| **Edge degradation** | Exit domain (Protocol 34: Rigged Game) |
| **2 consecutive triggers** | Full stop, external review required |

---

## 48.8 Application Examples

### Trading

- 5R drawdown → 24h stop → AAR → Resume at 0.5R or exit

### Relationships

- 3 unreciprocated bids → 1 week no-contact → AAR → Adjust approach or disengage

### Work

- 2 missed deadlines → Stop new commitments → AAR → Scope reduction or role change

### Spending

- 3 budget breaches → Freeze discretionary spending → AAR → Budget revision or envelope system

---

> **Core truth**: The system that doesn't have a circuit breaker will eventually experience catastrophic failure. The question is not IF but WHEN.
